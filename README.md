- 👋 Hi, I’m @MojtabaKD
- 👀 I’m interested in Mathematics and science in it's most general and deepest definitions.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning graduate math (Algebra and Algebraic Geometry + some computer science + ...)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any useful open source project which seems interesting to me.
- 📫 How to reach me --> mkbox86@gmail.com and @Deep_Crawler on telegram.
- I like wikipedia and started using it from it's first days to learn from it, and in fact it has taught and helped me a lot! I have started editing on it in the last few years.
